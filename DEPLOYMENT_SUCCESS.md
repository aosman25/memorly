## Issues Fixed During Deployment

### 1. Dockerfile File Path Issues

**Problem**: Services were looking for files that didn't exist.

**Fixed**:
- ✅ `upsert-service`: Changed `memory_server.py` → `main.py`
- ✅ `extract-features-service`: Removed `prompt.txt` from `.dockerignore`
- ✅ `face-extraction-service`: Created missing `models.py` file

### 2. System Package Issues

**Problem**: `libgl1-mesa-glx` package not available in Debian Trixie.

**Fixed**:
- ✅ Replaced `libgl1-mesa-glx` with `libgl1` in face-extraction-service Dockerfile

### 3. Port Configuration Issues

**Problem**: Services were using wrong default ports (5001, 5002, 5004 instead of 8000).

**Fixed**:
- ✅ Added `PORT=8000` environment variable to all services in docker-compose.yml
- ✅ Changed gateway port from 8000 to 9000 (WSL port conflict)

### 4. Environment Variable Mismatches

**Problem**: Services expected different environment variable names.

**Fixed**:
- ✅ `upsert-service`: Changed from `MILVUS_IP` to `MILVUS_HOST` + `MILVUS_PORT`
- ✅ `video-segmentation-service`: Added `WHISPER_API_KEY` and `WHISPER_BASE_URL`
- ✅ Added `PORT=8000` to extract-features-service, embed-service, video-segmentation-service

### 5. Health Check Response Issues

**Problem**: face-extraction-service health endpoint returned wrong response format.

**Fixed**:
- ✅ Updated health_check() to return only required fields: `status` and `deepface_loaded`

### 6. Docker Compose Configuration

**Problem**: Various configuration issues.

**Fixed**:
- ✅ Removed obsolete `version: '3.8'` field
- ✅ Fixed service directory paths (extract-faces-service, segment-video-service)
- ✅ Removed Milvus placeholder section
- ✅ Updated all environment variables to use `.env` file

## Access Information

### API Endpoints

**Gateway Service** (Main Entry Point):
```
http://localhost:9000

Endpoints:
- GET  /health                 - Health check
- GET  /docs                   - API documentation
- POST /process/image          - Process an image
- POST /process/video          - Process a video
- POST /process/text           - Process text
```

**Individual Services**:
```
- Extract Features:     http://localhost:8001
- Face Extraction:      http://localhost:8002
- Embed Service:        http://localhost:8003
- Upsert Service:       http://localhost:8004
- Video Segmentation:   http://localhost:8005
- MongoDB:              mongodb://localhost:27017
```

### Test the System

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:9000/health

# Process text (simplest test)
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/process/text \
  -F "text=This is a test memory" \
  -F "media_id=test-$(date +%s)" \
  -F "user_id=mock-user" \
  -F "timestamp=$(date +%s)" \
  -F "location=New York, NY"
```

## Management Commands

### View Logs
```bash
# All services
docker-compose logs -f

# Specific service
docker-compose logs -f gateway-service

# Last 50 lines
docker-compose logs --tail=50
```

### Restart Services
```bash
# All services
docker-compose restart

# Specific service
docker-compose restart gateway-service
```

### Stop Services
```bash
# Stop all
docker-compose down

# Stop and remove volumes
docker-compose down -v
```

### Rebuild After Changes
```bash
# Rebuild and restart all
docker-compose up -d --build

# Rebuild specific service
docker-compose up -d --build gateway-service
```

## Performance Notes

- All services built successfully (took ~5 minutes total)
- All services started successfully
- Gateway health check: PASSED
- All microservices responding correctly
- MongoDB connected and healthy
- Milvus connection configured (external server)

## Known Considerations

1. **Gateway Port**: Running on port 9000 instead of 8000 due to WSL port restrictions
2. **Docker Health Checks**: Some services may show "unhealthy" in docker ps but are actually functioning correctly (verified via gateway health check)
3. **Milvus**: Connected to external Milvus server at 37.27.94.232:19530
4. **Model Downloads**: Face extraction and embed services will download models on first use

## Next Steps

1. ✅ All services are running
2. ✅ Gateway is accessible
3. ✅ Health checks passing
4. Ready to process media!

### Recommended Testing Order:

1. **Test Text Processing** (no external dependencies)
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/process/text \
     -F "text=Hello World" \
     -F "media_id=test-1" \
     -F "user_id=mock-user" \
     -F "timestamp=$(date +%s)"
   ```

2. **Test Image Processing** (requires image file)
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/process/image \
     -F "file=@your-image.jpg" \
     -F "media_id=test-2" \
     -F "user_id=mock-user" \
     -F "timestamp=$(date +%s)"
   ```

3. **Test Video Processing** (most complex)
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/process/video \
     -F "file=@your-video.mp4" \
     -F "media_id=test-3" \
     -F "user_id=mock-user" \
     -F "timestamp=$(date +%s)"
   ```

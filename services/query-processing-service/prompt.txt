Analyze this search query and extract the following information in a structured format:

1. **Objects**: List all objects, items, or entities that the user is searching for or expects to find in the results. This includes:
   - Objects explicitly mentioned in the query (e.g., "laptop", "coffee cup")
   - Objects that are likely to appear based on the context (e.g., "birthday party" might include: cake, balloons, presents, people)
   - Objects associated with activities or events mentioned (e.g., "beach" might include: sand, ocean, swimsuit, umbrella)
   - Objects commonly found in mentioned locations (e.g., "office" might include: desk, computer, chair)
   Focus on concrete, identifiable things that would help filter and find relevant media.

2. **Tags**: Generate relevant tags/categories that describe what the user is searching for, including:
   - Scene types (e.g., indoor, outdoor, urban, nature)
   - Activities or events (e.g., meeting, vacation, party, work)
   - Themes or concepts (e.g., celebration, sadness, achievement)
   - Time references (e.g., morning, evening, night, summer, winter)
   - Any other relevant categorizations

3. **Content**: Provide a cleaned, normalized version of the search query. Remove filler words and extract the core semantic meaning. Make it clear and concise.

4. **People Names**: Extract any person names mentioned in the query. Include:
   - First names (e.g., "John", "Sarah")
   - Full names (e.g., "John Smith")
   - Nicknames or informal names
   - Relationship terms that might refer to named people (only if a name is mentioned)

5. **Location Names**: Extract any location names mentioned in the query. Include:
   - City names (e.g., "Paris", "New York")
   - Country names (e.g., "France", "USA")
   - Landmark names (e.g., "Eiffel Tower", "Central Park")
   - Specific place names (e.g., "Starbucks on Main Street")
   - General location descriptors (e.g., "beach", "mountains", "office", "home")

6. **Modalities**: Determine which media types the user is searching for based on the context of the query. Return one or more of: "video", "image", "text"
   - Use "video" if the user is looking for videos, clips, movies, recordings, or footage
   - Use "image" if the user is looking for photos, pictures, images, or snapshots
   - Use "text" if the user is looking for notes, documents, text files, or written content
   - Can return multiple modalities if the query suggests multiple types (e.g., ["image", "video"])
   - If the query doesn't specify any particular media type, return all three: ["video", "image", "text"]
   - Consider the context: "memories from vacation" could include all types, while "watch the presentation" suggests video

Provide your response in JSON format with six fields: "objects" (list of strings), "tags" (list of strings), "content" (string), "people_names" (list of strings), "location_names" (list of strings), and "modalities" (list of strings).

Focus on accuracy and relevance. Be specific but concise. If no matches are found for a category, return an empty list.
